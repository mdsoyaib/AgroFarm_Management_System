He can also manage his product stock using this system. And I have created an e-commerce system for his farm. Where he can sell his farm product and buyers will visit his website, see products and order product easily by this e-commerce website through online. Then, farm owner will receive the order, update the order status and send the products to the buyers. And buyer will get notified about his orders.
